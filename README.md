# TicTacToeStarter

The purpose of this starter code is to give you a functional driver program where all you 
need to do is work on the implementation of the actual Tic Tac Toe class.  You are more than
welcome to delete the driver program or also set up your own driver/modify it as you wish.

The way I would recommend you use this code is the following:

1. Set up a new repository called TicTacToeJava in github
2. Open Eclipse, browse to the REPOSITORY folder YOU JUST CREATED and set that as your workspace.
3. Create a Java Project in this workspace called TicTacToeGame
4. In this project, create a package called ticTacToeProblem
5. Download the two starter files in this repository and then copy them into your package in Eclipse.
6. Make an initial commit to Github with the changes 

7. As you code in Eclipse, Github desktop will keep track of all changes made everytime you save in Eclipse
   When you get certain features working you can "set them aside" with a commit/push to your repo
